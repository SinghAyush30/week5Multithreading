    "\n",
    "i)Multithreading introduces additional complexity to program design and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)Multithreading requires additional system resources to manage and switch between threads. Each thread has its own stack, register set, and other associated data structures. If a program creates too many threads, it can lead to excessive resource consumption, including increased memory usage and scheduling overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii)When multiple threads access shared data simultaneously, there is a risk of thread interference. "
